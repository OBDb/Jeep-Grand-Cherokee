    description: "The original Jeep Grand Cherokee was introduced as a more refined, upscale alternative to the Cherokee, targeting both off-road enthusiasts and luxury SUV buyers. Built on a unibody platform but maintaining true off-road capability with solid axles front and rear, it balanced on-road comfort with genuine Jeep ruggedness. Initially powered by AMC's 4.0L inline-six or an optional 5.2L V8, with a 5.9L V8 added later in the limited-production 5.9 Limited performance model. Available with several four-wheel drive systems including Command-Trac and the more advanced Quadra-Trac, plus rear-wheel drive in some markets. The interior was significantly more upscale than other Jeep models of the era, with available leather seating, power accessories, and premium audio. This generation established the Grand Cherokee as a versatile, capable SUV that could compete with both traditional off-roaders and emerging luxury SUVs, creating a formula that would define the model for decades."
