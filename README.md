## Generations

The Jeep Grand Cherokee has evolved through five distinct generations since its debut in 1992, establishing itself as one of the most capable and popular mid-size SUVs in the market:

### **First Generation ZJ (1993-1998)**
The first generation Grand Cherokee debuted at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in 1992 for the 1993 model year. The vehicle was dramatically unveiled when then-Chrysler president Robert Lutz drove Detroit's mayor Coleman Young from the Jefferson North Assembly Plant up the steps of Cobo Hall and through a plate-glass window. Unlike the Explorer, the Grand Cherokee used monocoque (unibody) construction, whereas the Explorer was a derivative of the Ranger pickup with a separate body-on-frame construction. The first-generation Grand Cherokee featured a 4.0L straight-six engine mated to a four-speed automatic transmission, with features including five-spoke alloy wheels, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.

### **Second Generation WJ (1999-2004)**
The second generation Grand Cherokee WJ was unveiled in Detroit on June 16, 1998, and production lasted until 2004. The WJ shared just 127 parts with its predecessor and was completely overhauled, being renowned for its off-road capability. While the 4.0L "Power-Tech" Inline Six-Cylinder engine and 42RE four-speed automatic transmission carried over from the previous generation, the previous 5.2L "Magnum" V8 engine was replaced by an all-new 4.7L "Power-Tech" V8 engine. The WJ benefited from new technology like GPS Navigation and Bluetooth, larger rims, upscale interior, and more powerful engines. A new automatic four-wheel drive system called Quadra-Drive was introduced.

### **Third Generation WK (2005-2010)**
The third generation Grand Cherokee WK debuted in 2004 for the 2005 model year at the New York International Auto Show with available Quadra-Drive II four-wheel drive, rear-seat DVD player and optional 5.7L Hemi V8. The 3.7L V6 engine replaced the 4.0L straight-six. The third-generation Grand Cherokee WK was introduced for the 2005 model year with most of the updates coming from the powertrain. Jeep replaced the XJ-era leading-arms live-axle front suspension with an independent double-wishbone setup.

### **Fourth Generation WK2 (2011-2021)**
The fourth generation WK2 Grand Cherokee went on sale in summer 2010 as a 2011 model and was unveiled at the 2009 New York Auto Show. It featured four-wheel independent suspension for better on-road handling. The WK2 introduced the 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine that remained standard equipment, while the 5.7L HEMI V8 remained optional. The SRT8 trim featured a 6.4L HEMI V8, and the Trackhawk trim introduced in 2018 borrowed the Hellcat engine from Dodge with a 6.2L supercharged HEMI V8 producing 707 horsepower. The WK2 was the longest-running Grand Cherokee generation, persisting until 2021 through two facelifts and many year-by-year changes.

### **Fifth Generation WL (2022-present)**
The fifth generation WL Grand Cherokee was revealed as the three-row LWB version Grand Cherokee L on January 7, 2021, with the two-row version revealed on September 30, 2021. For the first time in more than a decade, this generation was redesigned and replaced with a more upscale vehicle. Engine choices carried over from the previous generation with two naturally-aspirated units but added a turbocharged gasoline/electric plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powertrain. The 4xe PHEV powertrain produces 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque. The 2021 Grand Cherokee was built on the same platform used by the Stellantis group for the Alfa Romeo Stelvio and featured a lower roofline for a sleeker appearance.
